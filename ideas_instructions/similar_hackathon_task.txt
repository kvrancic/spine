Build the Superhuman AI Chief of Staff
Sponsored Track by OpenAI

The Moonshot
Search engines organize the world’s information.
Social media learned how to amplify information at global scale.
But inside organizations, information still spreads blindly.
Meetings, messages, emails, voice notes, and documents flow without intelligence.
Some people are overwhelmed.
Others are left out.
There is no true source of truth.
No map of how knowledge moves inside a company.
No transparency into who knows what and why.
The next frontier of AI is not answering questions.
It is organizing information for collective problem-solving.
This challenge asks:
Can we make information inside a company 100× more targeted, transparent, and actionable?

The Vision
Build an AI Operating System for Organizational Communication — a Superhuman AI Chief of Staff that becomes the brain of a company.
An agentic AI system that:
* Maps how information flows across teams

* Builds a stakeholder map and a company knowledge graph

* Creates a living source of truth

* Decides what to amplify, restrict, and route

* Maintains versioned organizational memory

* Works across text, voice, and visual interfaces

Not a chatbot.
Not a feed.
But a new intelligence layer for how organizations think and coordinate.

The Core Idea
Think of this as:
   * “Organizing the world’s information” — for a single organization

   * “Social media for knowledge” — but strategic, not viral

   * “Version control” — for organizational truth

Your system should answer:
      * Who needs to know this?

      * What is the current truth?

      * What just changed?

      * Where is knowledge blocked or duplicated?

The goal is not more communication.
It is better communication.

The Superhuman Element
At the center is an agentic AI that:
         * sees all communication,

         * understands dependencies,

         * resolves conflicts,

         * creates transparency,

         * and never overwhelms humans.

This AI is the company’s superpower:
its memory,
its filter,
its coordinator,
its Chief of Staff.
A Superhuman AI Co-Founder for communication and alignment.

The Challenge
Design a system that can:
            * Map information flow inside an organization

            * Build a stakeholder and knowledge graph

            * Create a living source of truth

            * Version and update knowledge continuously

            * Orchestrate communication across teams

            * Visualize how understanding spreads

            * Work across modalities (voice, text, mobile, visual)

This is not about features.
It is about inventing a new abstraction:
Organizational Intelligence.

Example Scenarios
               * A meeting ends → the AI updates the shared knowledge graph and notifies relevant stakeholders.

               * A decision is made → the AI version-stamps it and routes it to affected teams.

               * A founder asks: “What changed today?” → the AI generates a visual map of updates.

               * A new stakeholder joins → the AI creates an instant context view.

               * The AI detects conflicting information → a critic agent flags it for review.

Hints & Resources
To help you prototype, you may use existing datasets and tools that model organizational communication.
Sample Datasets (Proxies for Company Communication):
                  * Enron Email Dataset (public corporate email corpus with sender, receiver, timestamps, and message content)
→ Useful for building communication graphs and stakeholder maps

                  * SNAP Email Network Datasets (Stanford)
 → Useful for graph modeling and information flow analysis

                  * Public mailing-list or forum datasets (threads, participants, timestamps) as proxies for team communication

What to Extract from Data:
                     * People and teams

                     * Topics and decisions

                     * Communication frequency

                     * Dependencies

                     * Knowledge clusters

Technical Directions (Optional):
                        * Knowledge graphs (Neo4j, NetworkX, graph databases)

                        * LLMs for summarization and entity extraction

                        * Voice input and speech-to-text

                        * Visual dashboards for communication flow

                        * Multi-agent systems (memory agent, critic agent, coordinator agent)

Why It Matters
If this works, we unlock superhuman capacity in organizations.
Innovation accelerates.
Factories coordinate better.
Medical needs are delivered faster.
Decisions become visible and trustworthy.
Today, most organizations have no transparency into:
                           * how knowledge is distributed,

                           * how decisions propagate,

                           * or where communication breaks down.

By creating this transparency, we unlock alignment.
By unlocking alignment, we unlock speed.
This is the first step toward superhuman organizational intelligence.
An AI Chief of Staff.
A company brain.
A Superhuman AI Co-Founder.
A new way for humans and AI to solve problems together.
