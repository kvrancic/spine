John,

I wanted to flag some performance concerns with the analytics team. Their deliverables have been consistently late and quality has been declining over the past quarter.

I think we need to have a serious conversation about restructuring the team. This is really frustrating and I'm worried about the impact on our clients.

Can we meet privately to discuss?

Alice
